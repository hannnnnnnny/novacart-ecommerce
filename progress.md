# NovaCart Improvement Progress

## 2026-05-20 Session

- Loaded and followed `planning-with-files`, `ui-ux-pro-max`, and `find-skills` instructions.
- Verified repository remote and branch state.
- Ran `find-skills` search for Figma/design-system skills and decided not to install a Figma skill without a concrete Figma source.
- Ran `ui-ux-pro-max` design-system and Vue stack searches using bundled Python after the system Python alias failed.
- Created persistent planning files:
  - `task_plan.md`
  - `findings.md`
  - `progress.md`
- Audited repository file map, package manifests, route configuration, entrypoint, and page/component inventory.
- Logged initial issues around stale metadata, legacy page leftovers, missing catch-all route, and possible accidental backend npm lockfile.
- Audited Pinia stores and API wrappers. Logged generated-cart normalization and legacy named route concerns.
- Audited generated storefront product listing, product detail, checkout, support/refund flow, and route-link usage.
- Audited admin dashboard/product/order/theme-editor pages, backend merchant-store/order implementation, docs, and package metadata.
- Updated `task_plan.md` with concrete problems found before coding and moved Phase 1 into progress.
- Committed Phase 0 planning/audit as `33c3784 chore: add project improvement roadmap`.
- Implemented Phase 1 storefront reliability improvements:
  - Added generated storefront favorites with persisted per-store saved products.
  - Normalized generated cart localStorage data on load.
  - Improved checkout with postal code, delivery method, email validation, and submit loading state.
  - Added legacy route names/redirects and a catch-all 404 page.
  - Added lazy/async image loading to repeated product/template/cart imagery.
  - Updated frontend metadata for the multi-merchant ecommerce website builder positioning.
  - Refreshed backend Maven description and removed accidental Maven-backend npm lockfile.
- Phase 1 checks passed:
  - `npm.cmd run test:unit`
  - `npm.cmd run build`
  - `.\mvnw.cmd test`
- Implemented Phase 2 platform/admin polish:
  - Wired admin topbar notification count to unresolved support tickets and pending refund requests.
  - Added explicit save feedback to Store Setup and Theme Editor forms.
  - Disabled publishing when required store identity fields are empty.
  - Connected template preview links to generated storefront styling through the `templatePreview` query.
- Phase 2 checks passed:
  - `npm.cmd run test:unit`
  - `npm.cmd run build`
- Implemented Phase 3 code-quality/productivity polish:
  - Replaced the browser-prompt bulk discount workflow with an inline, validated merchant admin control.
  - Added saving/disabled states for the bulk discount creation action.
- Phase 3 checks passed:
  - `npm.cmd run test:unit`
  - `npm.cmd run build`
