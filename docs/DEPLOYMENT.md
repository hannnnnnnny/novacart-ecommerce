# NovaCart Deployment Notes

NovaCart is a portfolio ecommerce system. These notes describe safe deployment preparation without exposing real secrets or implying that the demo checkout is a real payment flow.

## Production Checklist

- Replace the default admin password after the first deployment.
- Set a long random `JWT_SECRET` through the hosting provider secret manager.
- Use managed MySQL credentials supplied through environment variables.
- Set `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to the deployed frontend origin.
- Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to the deployed backend API root before building the frontend.
- Configure HTTPS at the platform, load balancer, or reverse proxy layer.
- Add monitoring, backup, rate limiting, and log retention before real operational use.
- Integrate a payment provider before accepting real paid orders.

## Docker Compose

The repository includes `docker-compose.yml` for local containerized preview:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Local container URLs:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend API: `http://localhost:8080/api`
- MySQL: `localhost:3306`

The compose file uses local demo credentials only. Do not reuse those values in production.

## Backend Hosting

Render, Railway, Fly.io, and similar platforms can run the backend as a Java service or Docker container.

Required backend variables:

```text
DB_HOST=
DB_PORT=
DB_NAME=
DB_USERNAME=
DB_PASSWORD=
JWT_SECRET=
JWT_EXPIRATION_MINUTES=120
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend-domain.example
SERVER_PORT=8080
```

Build command for a Java service:

```bash
cd backend && ./mvnw -DskipTests package
```

Start command:

```bash
java -jar backend/target/backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## Frontend Hosting

Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, and static hosting platforms can serve the Vite build.

Required frontend variable:

```text
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-domain.example/api
```

Build command:

```bash
cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build
```

Publish directory:

```text
frontend/dist
```

## Database Hosting

Use a managed MySQL-compatible database for deployed environments. Configure network access only for the backend service and avoid exposing MySQL directly to the public internet.

Recommended operational safeguards:

- Automated backups.
- Point-in-time recovery if available.
- Restricted database users.
- Separate databases or schemas for staging and production.
- Migration strategy before production schema changes.

## Payment Limitation

NovaCart checkout creates an order and deducts stock, but no payment provider is connected. A real deployment that accepts payments should add provider-specific checkout sessions, webhook verification, idempotency keys, payment status reconciliation, and secure customer-facing order access.
